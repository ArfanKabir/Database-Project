# Database-Project
A mock database made for a Database Systems class using C++ and mySQL
They are able to connect using a program called Boost (that is way too complicated to connect)
Project taught that it is much easier to use a database with Java and/or Python, which also allow you to make
a GUI

C++ does not allow to make a GUI, while the other 2 do allow it
