# Database-Project
A mock database made for a Database Systems class using C++ and mySQL
They are able to connect using a program called Boost (that is way too complicated to connect)
Project taught that it is much easier to use a database with Java and/or Python, which also allow you to make
a GUI

C++ does not allow to make a GUI, while the other 2 do allow it

Also displays my ability to write mySQL queries
Used Object Oriented Programming Practices, as well as Paired Programming to build this project

University Database was built using a given schema
Airport Database was built from stratch with research done, as well as building an ER diagram and schema, and then converting
it into a database
